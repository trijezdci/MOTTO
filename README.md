## MOTTO â€” Classic Modula-2 Translator Tokyo

### A replacement for the venerable Modula-2 Compiler Karlsruhe (MOCKA) ###

MOTTO is a source to source Modula-2 Translator for the classic Modula-2 dialects described in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th editions of Niklaus Wirth's book "Programming in Modula-2" (PIM) published by Springer Verlag and is intended as a replacement for the venerable MOCKA compiler. Due to a backend generated by an undocumented proprietary backend generator, MOCKA will forever be limited to the Intel x86 32-bit architecture and a replacement that is platform independent and 100% open source is therefore desirable.

MOTTO will translate source files written in the classic dialects, including language extensions of the MOCKA compiler, to semantically equivalent source files in C99 and Modula-2 Revision 2010 (M2R10). ISO Modula-2 will **not** be supported.

As of April 2023, the project has been repurposed from its original objective and scope. Rework will take some time.
