# M2T

Classic Modula-2 Source to Source Translator

M2T is a multi-dialect Modula-2 to C translator and via-C compiler. It supports the dialects described in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th editions of Niklaus Wirth's book "Programming in Modula-2" (PIM) published by Springer Verlag. It does not support ISO Modula-2.

M2T translates source files written in the classic dialects (PIM2,3,4) to semantically equivalent source files in Modula-2 Revision 2010 (M2R10).
